# squirrelbot
General purpose Discord bot built using [eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris)

## To run yourself
1. Clone the repo locally
2. Inside the repo run `npm install --no-optional`
  * If you're on linux, install whatever it asks you to.
  * If you're on windows, start praying to the build gods. Try running `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` and google whatever other problems you run into.
  * If you **_really_** can't figure it out, and are really desperate, come bother people [here](https://discord.gg/9UZwzNK)
3. Configure `config.json` as detailed within the wiki. (coming soon)
4. Run `node index.js`
